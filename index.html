                                and I was always the go-to IT person in our circle of family and friends. I studied a few semesters of Architecture and Computer Science, before leaving uni to work as a Jr .NET Developer. I worked in development for a
                                few years before transitioning into an IT focussed sales position. I now have returned to my studies several years later with a renewed motivation to complete my degree here at RMIT. I am hoping to develop both personally
                                and professionally, and it all starts here in the Introduction to IT subject, as part of The Notorious Geeks.</p>

                                1998, where my first role was as aTechnician building PC’s for a large Computer store. In 1999, the store I worked at launched their own ISP, and as I had extensive experience with Unix and Linux, I became a System Administrator.

                            <p class='introductionP'>My name is Mohamed Abdirashid Ali I was born in Kenya, Nairobi within a refugee camp due to a civil war in Somalia. In 1998 my family and I migrated to South Australia, Adelaide where I received citizenship and lived for several
                                years. In 2010 we moved from Adelaide to Victoria, Melbourne where my mom opened up a furniture store In Glenroy. In the family there are eight of us, four brothers and three sisters, two brothers are married with children
                                and one sister is married with children. I am an uncle to three girls and one boy. In the family household I speak either English or Somali. I enjoy exercise and trying out different cultural food as a hobby. In 2020 I
                                am in my first year of university as an OUA student through RMIT studying both introduction to information technology and introduction to programming, student number s3450966. I am new to the IT industry, however, since
                                March up until now (April) I have learnt many aspects of IT such as cloud computing, self-driving cars, ethics within the industry , copyright laws, E-wallets and much more. Now I am part of a team project which we named
                                notorious geeks. I am particularly interested in the security aspect of IT because of my background as a security supervisor.</p>

                        <p>According to the Myers-Briggs test, our group has a balanced dynamic and everyone brings different qualities to the team that benefit everyone. Ali’s personality type (Mediator) allows him to be inspired by ideas rather than logic
                            and analytics, and it often allows him to be a bridge between different ideas and perspectives. Omer (Advocate) complements Ali’s personality type quite well in that he has large ambitions and ideas and is also led by morality.
                            He can also see the practical steps to get there. He is inspired by morality and idealism, and can easily get to the heart of an issue. Troy (Architect) has a propension for analytics which can be used to gather data and ensure
                            the rest of the group has all the information we need to make decisions. Architect’s are great at design and implementing effective plans. Mohamed (Protagonist) brings everything together by being a natural born leader and
                            is able to bring out the best in everyone and make sure they have what they need. Each of us have different learning styles, which means we can bounce ideas off of eachother and make sure none of us get left behind. Information
                            can be displayed in different ways and from different perspectives, and this is a very healthy way to learn. Overall, our group is incredibly balanced and our skills complement each other. We each bring something different
                            to the table, but our styles get along and we are able to collaborate effectively.

                        <p>A product manager is an eclectic role that requires superior organisational and communication skills, and needs to be able to dabble in everything and coordinate with multiple stakeholders. For that reason, the argument can be
                            made that nearly all the generic skills listed can be required. Many of the skills encompass others, for example, communication includes writing and presentation. Looking at this data has not necessarily changed my perception
                            of the position, but it has given me an appreciation of how many skills are involved in being a Product Manager. I have a long way to go and a lot to learn. The path to becoming a product manager is not necessarily linear because
                            there are so many different skills involved, but it is certainly very interesting.</p>

                        <p>What the Data tells me is that this role contains very desirable skills, some of which are rated in the top 20, and all in the Top 100. While there was no listing for AutoCAD specifically, Computer Aided Design does encapsulate
                            this skill. Many of the generic skills listed are in the top 20, such as Multitasking and Communication skills, (rank 20 and 1 respectively) which I also expected. I did suspect the lack of Electronics and Hardware skills are
                            reflected in the fact that this role is Hardware and Software based in an industry where the majority of roles are Software based. My opinion has not changed, this role appeals to me greatly because of its diversity. Having
                            worked in IT for almost 20 years, initially as a Technician, and then working my way up to a Linux/Unix System Administrator, what I enjoyed about my role is the multiple roles I would have to fill. I enjoy learning new skills
                            and working on multiple types of tasks greatly. Having worked in IT, I knew SQL would be very high on the list of desirable skills, being quite well versed in administration of SQL server instances. I am however extremely surprised
                            Visual Basic is still in the Top 100 of desired skills, as this has been superseded by VB.NET. I assume this is due to legacy systems, and from personal experience Firmware is not often written in the “newest and greatest”
                            language of the day. For example ADA, which is a programming language first developed in the late 1970’s is still used in the Military for mission critical devices. After I complete my current studies (Bachelor of Information
                            Technology at RMIT) if my health permits, I would really like to proceed with a Bachelor of Mechatronics. Securing a role such as this, or starting my own similar project, would be the end goal of those studies.

                                            and validate some of the hypotheses we have. We take this feedback directly from the clients and build it into our product strategy.. and also our plan of improving the platform in general.” “Another way (we

                                            technology to solve a problem that is hard to crack otherwise for example what we do is that we are taking a traditional problem. The problem of matching business projects with the right people and instead of
                                            doing this completely traditionally with relying on only human intelligence we basically add technology in the mix to help do it in a more optimised way. Another example could be food delivery for example this
                                            basically is like a traditional service that many restaurants are doing in a traditional fashion but if you add technology in the mix then you can optimise your operations which could lead to happier customers
                                            like faster deliveries, more reliable deliveries and basically make your business standout compared to competition"</p>

                </div>
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>

                    The project is a mobile application that will allow users to find nearby public bathrooms and bathrooms in shops and restaurants that are open to patrons. The application will list all nearby bathrooms and an overall cleanliness rating. Users will also
                    be able to rate bathrooms they visit and provide feedback. Owners of each bathroom will need to be verified and will be able to provide feedback by replying directly to users or giving bathroom updates such as “recently cleaned”. The
                    application will be available on iOS and Android, as well as having an online portal for users and owners/councils.


                </p>
                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest problems people have when they are out and about is finding a clean toilet. This application addresses several issues. Firstly, it allows users to find clean and hygenic bathrooms when they are out and about or travelling – both locals
                    and tourists. This allows people to complete their business with peace of mind. It provides valuable information for those who are disabled or for mothers with young children. It motivates business owners to keep their establishment
                    clean and creates extra foot traffic to generate business. Business owners can also market deals and special offers through the application to attract users and advertise their business.


                </p>

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <b> User Application:</b>
                <p>
                    <li><b>Signup:</b> use email, gmail, or facebook. The application requires first name, last name, email, optional mobile number, agreement to T&C</li>
                    <li><b>Login::</b> enter email and password, as well as optional TFA via text message.</li>
                    <li><b>GPS Map:</b> The application will require access to location services and have google maps integration. Based on your current location the application will show all nearby toilets and bathrooms, represented by a small icon.</li>
                    <li><b>Bathroom icons:</b>The icons will show a rating (e.g. 3.5), a business icon, and a glow around the icon to indicate there may be a special offering or deal. You can press the icon above each bathroom to show you additional information
                        including the establishment name, rating out of 5, more details regarding the offer, and opening hours. There will also be an option to “navigate here” which will send the information to google maps for navigation. The icons will
                        also allow you to favourite and share bathrooms via multiple channels (FB, Twitter, Insta, text, WhatsApp, Telegram, etc).</li>
                    <li><b>Feedback:</b> On each icon for a bathroom, you will be able to see the current rating of the bathroom, how many ratings it has, comments from patrons, replies from the owner, and the time it was last cleaned as provided by the owner.
                        There will be an option to provide feedback. The feedback option is initially greyed out and will only allow you to provide feedback if you have recently navigated to the bathroom (within the last hour). This is to prevent people
                        from rating bathrooms without actually going there.</li>
                    <li><b>Offers:</b> Each icon could display an offer or deal by the owner of the shop/restaurant. In order to use the deal, you will need to claim it through the application and provide the verification code at the establishment.</li>
                    <li><b>Profile:</b> Each user will have access to their own profile which tracks metrics such as how many bathrooms they have navigated to, how many they have rated, how many deals they have claimed, and if they have received any replies
                        to their feedback. Users can also view and edit their list of favourite bathrooms. The application also has standard functionality such as updating their details and deleting their account.</li>
                    <li><b>Add bathrooms to map:</b> Users can also add bathrooms to maps which will be added to the application database pending verification.</li>



                </p>
                <b> Owner Application:</b>
                <p>
                    <li><b>Signup/login as Owner:</b> An owner can register and must provide proof of business in order to verify.</li>
                    <li><b>Updates:</b>> Owners will be able to update their opening hours as well provide the last update as to when they last cleaned the bathroom.</li>
                    <li><b>Offers:</b> Owners can provide offers through the app and verify the offer codes of parsons</li>
                    <li><b>Metrics:</b> Owners can track how many people have navigated to their bathroom, how many have provided ratings, how many people have viewed their bathroom, how many people have viewed their offers, and how many people have claimed
                        their offers. They will also be able to view these metrics visually over time which can indicate performance, e,g growth or decline in use.</li>
                    <li><b>Feedback:</b> Owners can respond to feedback or report feedback as inaccurate.</li>

                <h4>Technologies</h4>
                <p>
                    The application will be built natively on both iOS and Android. The iOS application will be built using Swift, and the Android application will be built using Java. The application will have a Node.JS backend hosted on AWS. The website front-end will
                    be built using React. The application will require integration with several services such as Facebook, Gmail, Google Maps, and potentially several Point Of Sale systems used by owners in order to track their deals.
                </p>

                <h4>Skills Required</h4>
                <p>
                    This project will require a product manager or project manager to oversee all the different pieces. Initially, a UI/UX designer is needed in order to provide wireframes, userflows, mockups, branding, and usability research amongst businesses and potential
                    users. From there, the project will need a backend developer, a web developer, an Android developer, and an iOS developer. These roles may overlap or require more than one person in a given area depending on the scope and scale of
                    the project. It would potentially need a devops engineer and a QA analyst as well. Required hardware would mostly be iOS and Android devices for testing purposes which are quite easy to come by. All the software skills are mainstream
                    skills and abundant in the industry.
                </p>

                <h4>Outcome</h4>
                <p>
                    The outcome of this project is that users will have a better experience relieving themselves in public restrooms, and businesses generate more foot traffic. The problem is solved by incentivising businesses to clean their restrooms and attract more users
                    by offering deals. The impact is improved hygienic practices in businesses, which can leave lasting impressions on users and motivate them to come back to particular establishments. A secondary benefit is improved health, as cleanliness
                    and hygiene become front of mind when out in public.
